## About Me :wave:

Hey there! :smile: My name is Bohdan. I'm a 27-year-old fallow iOS developer from Ukraine, and currently reside in Chicago, USA. I just finished a Full Stack Developer Program at [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com), and I'm looking for open-source projects to contribute to and people to collaborate with! I love creating and tinkering with small, Networking, or playing with different framworks, but maintaining SOLID method. 

I'm always looking to work with people that are hopeless idealists like me, as well as who are interested in creating and working on cool, interesting, and meaningful projects! Shoot me [an e-mail](mailto:tech.bohdan@gmail.com) if that sounds like your cup of coffee. :coffee:
